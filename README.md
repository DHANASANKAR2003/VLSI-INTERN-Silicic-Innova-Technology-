# 🔧 Verilog Achievements

This repository includes a variety of **Verilog programs** grouped into:

- ⚙️ **Combinational Logic Circuits**
- 🔄 **Sequential Logic Circuits**
- 🚀 **Verilog-Based Mini Projects**

These files are created for learning, simulation, and FPGA prototyping.

## ⚙️ Combinational Logic

These modules produce output based only on the current input. Examples include:

- Adders (Half, Full)
- Multiplexers / DeMultiplexers
- Encoders / Decoders
- Comparators
- Logic gates

---

## 🔄 Sequential Logic

These modules depend on both current input and previous states (clocked). Examples include:

- Flip-Flops (SR, D, T, JK)
- Counters (up/down, mod-N)
- Shift Registers
- FSMs (Finite State Machines)

---

## 🚀 Verilog Mini Projects

Larger modules that combine combinational/sequential logic for specific applications:

- **UART Transmitter/Receiver**
- **Sobel Edge Detection (with Python integration)**
- **Voting Machine**

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Icarus Verilog (simulation)
- GTKWave (waveform viewer)
- Vivado (FPGA synthesis)
- Python (for image or data input/output in some projects)
