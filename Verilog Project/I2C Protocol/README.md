# üß† Verilog I¬≤C Master-Slave Protocol

## üìå Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete Verilog-based implementation of the I¬≤C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol. It includes:
- A fully functional I¬≤C Master controller with FSM
- Five independent I¬≤C Slave controllers (with unique addresses)
- Bit-level signal handling of SDA/SCL
- Read and Write operations

Simulated and tested using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.

# üß† Verilog I¬≤C Slave Controllers FSM

This section documents the internal **FSM (Finite State Machine)** structure of all five `i2c_slave_controller` modules used in the I¬≤C Master-Slave Verilog project.

Each slave behaves identically in terms of control logic, with a unique 7-bit address. They handle address detection, acknowledgment (ACK), and read/write operations through state transitions triggered by SDA/SCL changes.
